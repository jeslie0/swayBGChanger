#+title: Sway Background Changer
This is a project originally inspired by [[https://sylvaindurand.org/dynamic-wallpapers-with-sway/][Sylvain Durand]]'s blog post on Dynamic Wallpapers with Sway. It is designed to change the sway wallpaper. Currently, it required that both sway and swaybg be on the PATH, although I will be aiming to fix that at some point. This is set up as a nix flake, but it is also a cabal project. Either method will result in a working programme.

* How to use
You need to give it a folder of images to choose from, and a duration (in seconds). A sway configuration would look like this:
#+begin_src bash
exec "swaybgchanger {FOLDER/PATH} {SECONDS}"
#+end_src

This is a work in progress.
