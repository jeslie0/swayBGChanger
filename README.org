#+title: Sway Background Changer
This project is basically a nix project containing the code from [[https://sylvaindurand.org/dynamic-wallpapers-with-sway/][Sylvain Durand]]'s blog post on Dynamic Wallpapers with Sway, with some small edits.

To use this, download the repository and run =chmod +x swayBGChanger.sh=. Then, to use it put the following in your Sway configuration file:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
exec "swayBGChanger /PATH/TO/WALLPAPER/FOLDER"
#+END_SRC

Then, restart sway. This will cause the images in the specified folder to be randomly chosen for the wallpaper, every 10 minutes.
